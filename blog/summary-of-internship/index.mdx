# Reflections on Three Months Internship at a Startup
In August, I entered a startup company with anticipation and cautiousness, embarking on a three-month internship journey. Here, I want to summarize my experiences, insights, and future plans. This internship was quite different from my previous one, offering me a fresh perspective on startup culture.

## Getting Acquainted: The Process of Mutual Understanding and Familiarity

The company was small, with a development team of only about ten people. Despite its size, it had all the necessary components: Android and iOS development, backend development, frontend development, product management, and UI design. Daily, developers worked together in a cozy workspace, devoid of strict rules, with flexible hours and a sense of freedom. I vividly remember one morning when developers, product managers, and designers gathered in the same room, discussing requirements, design drafts, and bug solutions. The vibrant atmosphere made me forget I was at work. This was my first impression of the startup – energetic and collaborative. The feeling of striving together for a common goal is indeed invigorating.

## My Work

### Attitude Shift

During the first week, I focused on setting up development tools and environments, familiarizing myself with the team's workflow and processes. Soon after, I received my first task – developing the company's official website. It mainly involved creating two static pages (one for mobile and one for PC), which seemed straightforward to me at first. However, the frontend developer frowned upon reviewing my code, pointing out numerous areas for improvement and suggesting I learn Gulp for enhanced development efficiency. The UI designer also provided a lengthy list of modifications, including minute details like icon alignment and text indentation. It dawned on me that I had underestimated the job. Even something as seemingly simple as page restructuring required personal skill and dedication. Work isn't about simplicity; it's about striving for excellence in every task.

Subsequently, I spent a week refining the website. During this time, I learned how to use Gulp for frontend development, significantly improving my workflow. Additionally, I addressed PC compatibility issues and mobile responsiveness, paying attention to details I previously overlooked. The process was hectic but immensely rewarding. Seeing the website go live, appreciated by others, brought indescribable joy. My first task taught me valuable lessons, especially regarding work attitude – to treat every task as a masterpiece, striving for perfection and taking responsibility for my work.

### Skill Enhancement

Over the next two months, I participated in several projects, gradually gaining recognition for my contributions. Later, the team leader assigned me a challenging task – revamping the operation backend while taking on an architectural role. As the frontend and backend were separated, I delved into learning Angular and familiarizing myself with the interface documentation. Although I was initially apprehensive about my capabilities, I accepted the challenge.

After studying Angular during the National Day holiday, I began working on the project. I learned and implemented project architecture, successfully running basic functionalities. Subsequently, I collaborated with another frontend developer to finalize the remaining features. This project not only provided hands-on experience with Angular but also highlighted the importance of continuous learning in the rapidly evolving frontend landscape. While encountering unfamiliar technologies was initially daunting, I realized that confronting challenges, learning, and problem-solving invigorated me. Although I now recognize areas for improvement, this project significantly enhanced my skills and taught me the essence of learning new frameworks.

### Lessons on Emotional Management and Team Collaboration

Just a week before leaving, an unpleasant incident occurred in the company. I had spent considerable time and effort perfecting the WeChat public account's education verification function and intended to inspect and optimize the operation backend code (as I was leaving soon, I wanted to leave everything in good order). However, the next day, the product manager suggested a significant requirement change. While I agreed to the change, I felt overwhelmed by the thought of having to work overtime to meet the deadline. My emotions fluctuated, affecting my work, and my colleagues seemed to notice. One colleague directly advised me to improve my professional conduct. Confused by the misunderstanding, I couldn't contain my emotions, resulting in an unproductive evening and leaving promptly at the end of the day. Reflecting on the situation, I realized my shortcomings. I lacked contemplation in handling situations and often suppressed emotions without communicating, leading to misunderstandings. Emotional outbursts over trivial matters could impact the entire team. This incident taught me valuable lessons on communication and emotional management. Effective communication and emotional regulation are crucial in the workplace. Moreover, expressing thoughts and feelings is essential for mutual understanding.

## Conclusion

This internship provided significant learning opportunities, enhancing both my technical skills and teamwork abilities. I met numerous individuals, grateful for their enthusiastic assistance. Through this experience, I identified areas for personal growth and aim to continue improving myself in various aspects. On the last day, I was grateful for the farewell party organized by my colleagues, enjoying delicious Japanese cuisine, and joyfully concluding my three-month internship. This fulfilling experience contributed immensely to my growth. Attached is a photo of the developers' work scene, commemorating the unforgettable internship moments.
