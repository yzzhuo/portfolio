### Theme

Disability Inclusion in Employment

### Motivation

"Decent work and economic growth" is Goal 8 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ([SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8#overview)), which focuses on promoting economic growth and providing decent work. The number of people with disabilities is increasing due to the rise in non-communicable diseases and people living longer. In this context, analyzing the employment of persons with disabilities can provide valuable insights and opportunities for clear understanding of this goal.
