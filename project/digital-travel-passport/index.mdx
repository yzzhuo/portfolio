### Introduction

For people who like traveling and exploring new places, they may be proud of lots of stamps they have on their passport. Some travelers like to document their experiences through photos, notes, or journal entries. However, many people currently can only reminisce about their past travels by relying on scattered mobile photos or some posts buried in their social media history.

We aim to create a digital travel passport for them, providing them with the ability to record and share their travel experiences with others.

### Main Functionality of the Service

Our project is a small-scale application, offering users a straightforward and user-friendly process to record and share their travel memories. The aim is to help users easily organize and relive their travel experiences.

The main functionality of our service:

1. Browser main tourist attractions of the selected city
2. Select the destination place to get a stamp according to the userâ€™s current location.
3. Record their experiences of a place through notes, photos and the date of visit.
4. Preview their digital travel passport which contains a summary of their travel records and memories of each place.
5. Share their digital travel passport with others.
